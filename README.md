## Development

There are configuration options in [esbuild.config.js](esbuild.config.js) (for example - specify whether you're building for Firefox or Chrome)

In your terminal, run:

    ./start

To build and watch - which will build using the configuration options `esbuild.config.js`

To build the publishable version, use `NODE_ENV=production yarn build` - which will build with `https://www.convus.org` as the source.

Create a zip of the built extension for submission with:

    ./makezip

Lint with `yarn lint`

Lint HTML with `htmlbeautifier src/index.html`

_NOTE: ðŸ‘† isn't great - it requires Ruby and [htmlbeautifier](https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier/), which isn't actually bundled/packaged here_
